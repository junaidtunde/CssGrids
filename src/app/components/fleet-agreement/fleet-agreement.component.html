    <div class="body-text">
      DASH provides a mobile app and web-based technology platform that connects customers, retail stores, and restaurants,
      with independent contractors to facilitate on-demand delivery services (the "DASH Platform" or "Platform"). Through the
      DASH Platform customers may request that merchandise or food be delivered to them from particular retail locations or
      restaurants. Independent Contractors can access the DASH Platform and receive Delivery Opportunities (as defined in
      section 3A. below). DASH is not a retail store, restaurant, food delivery service, merchandise delivery service, or
      food preparation entity.
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="body-text">
      Contractor is a fully-licensed, independent provider of delivery services, authorized to conduct the delivery services contemplated by this Agreement in the geographic location(s) in which Contractor operates. Contractor is in lawful possession of all equipment (including a motor vehicle or bicycle, if applicable) necessary to perform the delivery services contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with all applicable laws. Contractor desires to enter into this Agreement for the right to access the DASH Platform to receive delivery opportunities made available through the Platform. When performing services pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Contractor understands and expressly agrees that Contractor is not doing so as an employee of DASH, any Merchant, or customer. Contractor understands Contractor is free to select those times Contractor wishes to be available on the DASH Platform to receive delivery opportunities and to select only those deliveries Contractor wishes to select.
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="body-text">
      In consideration of the above recitals and the mutual promises below, and for other good and valuable consideration, DASH and Contractor (collectively "the Parties") agree as follows:
    </div>

    <div style="text-align: left">
      <h5 style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">1. Purpose of Agreement</h5>
    </div>

    <div class="body-text-small">
      1A. This Agreement governs the entire relationship between DASH and Contractor, and establishes the Parties' respective rights and obligations applicable to the "Delivery Opportunities" (as defined in Section 3A below) made available to Contractor through the Platform. In exchange for the promises contained in this Agreement, Contractor shall have the contractual right and obligation to perform those Delivery Opportunities that Contractor accepts ("Deliveries", defined in Section 3A below). However, except as expressly stated in Section 12, "Term and Termination," below, nothing in this Agreement requires Contractor to perform any particular Delivery during the Term of this Agreement, and nothing in this Agreement shall guarantee Contractor any particular volume of Delivery Opportunities or Deliveries for any particular time period.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="body-text-small">
      1B. Per the terms of this Agreement, Contractor shall be contractually bound to complete the Deliveries in accordance with any specifications provided by the customer and/or Merchant (as defined in Section 3A below).
    </div>

    <div style="text-align: left">
      <h5 style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">2. Contractor's Services</h5>
    </div>

    <div class="body-text-small">
      2A. Contractor agrees and represents that Contractor is an independent provider of delivery services, and that Contractor satisfies all legal requirements necessary to perform the services contemplated by this Agreement. As an independent contractor, Contractor shall be solely responsible for determining how to lawfully perform Deliveries.
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="body-text-small">
      2B. Contractor agrees to fully perform all Deliveries accepted in a timely, efficient, safe and lawful manner. DASH shall have no right to, and shall not, supervise, direct or control Contractor, or control the manner or prescribe the method Contractor uses to perform Deliveries, and the general public and all governmental agencies regulating the activities contemplated by this Agreement shall be so informed. Contractor shall be solely responsible for determining the most effective, efficient, satisfactory, and safe manner to perform Deliveries, including determining the manner of pickup, delivery, and route selection. The Parties acknowledge and agree that those provisions of the Agreement reserving ultimate authority in DASH have been inserted solely to achieve compliance with federal, state, or local laws, regulations, and interpretations thereof and/or to ensure the safety of the Platform for all users.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="body-text-small">
      2C. Contractor expressly acknowledges and agrees that as a separately established provider of delivery services, Contractor retains the right to perform services for others and to hold itself out to the general public as a separately established provider of delivery services. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Contractor or DASH from engaging in similar arrangements or business with others. DASH neither has nor reserves the right to restrict Contractor at any time from performing delivery services for other entities, or customers, even should such business directly compete with DASH. Provided Contractor can meet the customer's specifications, and unless prohibited by law, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Contractor from carrying and/or delivering goods for other(s) of Contractor's customers at the same time while delivering orders requested by customers through the DASH Platform. Similarly, Contractor is not limited in any way from being actively logged onto online platforms other than the DASH Platform while actively logged onto the Postmates Platform, subject only to the limitation that Contractor's use of other online platforms may not prevent Contractor's ability to timely, efficiently and safely complete any Deliveries Contractor has accepted through the DASH Platform.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="body-text-small">
      2D. Contractor is not required to purchase, lease, or rent any products, equipment, or services from DASH as a condition of doing business with DASH or entering into this Agreement.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="body-text-small">
      2E. Contractor agrees that to ensure the safety of the DASH Platform, DASH shall require that Contractor submit to and pass a background check before Contractor receives access to the DASH Platform or is given continued access to the Platform. Additionally, , Contractor agrees that, in accordance with applicable law and at DASH' sole discretion, periodically during the term of this Agreement (as defined in Section 12 below) DASH may require that Contractor submit to and pass additional background check(s). DASH agrees that any such check(s) may be conducted only with Contractor's consent (as applicable) and in accordance with applicable law.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="body-text-small">
      2F. On occasion, DASH may offer Contractor different promotions or referral programs. Contractor agrees not to abuse or manipulate the referral programs or promotions. Contractor understands that any abuse or manipulation constitutes a material breach of this Agreement and may lead to deactivation.
    </div>

    <div style="text-align: left">
      <h5 style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">3. Deliveries</h5>
    </div>

    <div class="body-text-small">
      3A. While Contractor is actively logged onto the DASH Platform, the Platform will, from time to time, notify Contractor of the opportunity to complete deliveries from restaurants or retail stores to customers as ordered by customers through the Platform (each, a "Delivery Opportunity"). With respect to each Delivery Opportunity accepted by Contractor (a "Delivery"), Contractor agrees to retrieve the order from restaurants and/or retail locations, (collectively "Merchants") and deliver the order to customers in a timely fashion. Contractor understands that the customer, not DASH, determines the content of the Delivery. Contractor understands that DASH shall have no right to, and shall not, supervise, direct, or control the manner or prescribe the method Contractor uses to perform the Delivery. Contractor understands and agrees that the parameters of each Delivery are established by the customer, not Favoumates, and represent the end result desired, not the means by which Contractor is to accomplish the end result.
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="body-text-small">
      3B. Contractor agrees that DASH has discretion regarding which, if any, Delivery Opportunities to offer Contractor, just as Contractor has the discretion whether and to what extent to accept any Delivery Opportunity.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="body-text-small">
      3C. Contractor agrees that if Contractor accepts a Delivery Opportunity that includes alcohol, Contractor is solely responsible for ensuring that the Delivery complies with all federal, state, and local laws, including but not limited to ensuring that the individual accepting the delivery is the individual who placed the order, has provided valid identification, is 18 years old or older, and is not intoxicated.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="body-text-small">
      3D. Contractor agrees that DASH may provide Contractor with a prepaid debit card that Contractor will use to complete certain Deliveries. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any unauthorized use of this prepaid debit card will be considered theft and/or fraud, and may lead to deactivation of Contractor's account and prosecution by the law. If Contractor loses the prepaid debit card, Contractor will report the loss to DASH immediately.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="body-text-small">
      3E. Contractor authorizes DASH, during the course of a Delivery, to communicate with Contractor, customer and/or Merchant to assist Contractor, to the extent permitted by Contractor, in facilitating deliveries. However, under no circumstances shall DASH be authorized to control the manner or means by which Contractor performs a Delivery.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="body-text-small">
      3F. In the event Contractor fails to fully perform any Delivery due to Contractor's action or omission (a "Service Failure"), DASH reserves the right to recover any costs incurred by DASH related to the Service Failure. If Contractor fails to complete a return of any item that cannot be delivered (a "Return Failure"), DASH reserves the right to recover any costs incurred by DASH related to the Return Failure. If Contractor disputes responsibility for a Service Failure or Return Failure, the dispute shall be resolved pursuant to the "Payment Disputes" provision in Section 5 below.
    </div>

    <div style="text-align: left">
      <h5 style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">4. Delivery Fees</h5>
    </div>

    <div class="body-text-small">
      4A. Contractor agrees to receive a delivery fee paid through the Postmates Platform in exchange for each Delivery completed. DASH agrees to use its best efforts to establish delivery fees for each locality and time slot that will maximize the Delivery Opportunities available to Contractor. Contractor will receive notice of how delivery fees are calculated prior to accepting Delivery. Contractor understands that delivery fees paid through the Platform may vary depending on customer demand. DASH may, but is not obligated to, offer Contractor additional incentives to complete particular Delivery Opportunities.
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="body-text-small">
      4B. DASH agrees to transmit delivery fees to Contractor via direct deposit no later than seven (7) days after Contractor successfully completes the related Delivery through the Platform. Contractor is responsible for any applicable processing fees associated with such remittance.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="body-text-small">
      4C. Nothing in this Section 4 is intended to limit the Parties' ability during the Term of this Agreement (as defined in Section 12 below) to mutually agree to a payment structure different than that described herein.
    </div>

    <div style="text-align: left">
      <h5 style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">5. Payment Disputes</h5>
    </div>

    <div class="body-text-small">
      5A. Contractor's Failure: In the event there is a Service Failure, Contractor may forfeit all or a portion of the fee relating to that Delivery (depending on the extent of the performance failure). Any reduction in the delivery fee shall be based upon proof provided by the customer, Merchant, Contractor, and any other party with information relevant to the dispute. DASH shall make the initial determination as to whether a Service Failure was the result of Contractor's action/omission and, if so, what percentage of fault Contractor shall bear (and, therefore, what percentage of the delivery fee Contractor shall be paid). Contractor shall have the right to challenge DASH' determination as described in the provisions set forth in Sections 11 and 12, below.
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="body-text-small">
      5B. DASH' Failure: In the event DASH fails to remit payment of delivery fees in a timely or accurate manner, Contractor shall have the right to seek proper payment by any legal means contemplated by this Agreement, provided, however, Contractor first informs DASH in writing of the failure and provides a reasonable opportunity to cure it.
    </div>

    <div style="text-align: left">
      <h5 style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">6. Contractor's Equipment</h5>
    </div>

    <div class="body-text-small">
      6A. Contractor certifies that Contractor has all equipment, including motor vehicles, scooters and bicycles, when applicable ("Equipment") necessary to perform Deliveries. When Contractor uses a vehicle or scooter to perform a Delivery, Contractor is solely responsible for ensuring that the vehicle or scooter used conforms to all vehicle laws pertaining to safety, equipment, inspection, and operational capability.
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="body-text-small">
      6B. Contractor is responsible for all costs and expenses arising from Contractor's performance of Deliveries, including, but not limited to, traffic tickets, tolls, parking fees, inspections, and any other costs related to Equipment. Except as otherwise required by law, Contractor assumes all risk of damage or loss to its Equipment.
    </div>

    <div style="text-align: left">
      <h5 style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">7. Relationship of Parties</h5>
    </div>

    <div class="body-text-small">
      7A. The Parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement is between independent businesses that are separately owned and operated. The Parties intend this Agreement to create the relationship of principal and independent Contractor and not that of employer and employee. The Parties are not employees, agents, joint venturers or partners of each other for any purpose. Neither party shall have the right to bind the other by contract or otherwise except as specifically provided in this Agreement.
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="body-text-small">
      7B. For a Contractor who earns the minimum income established by the Internal Revenue Service, DASH shall report all payments made to Contractor on a calendar year basis. Contractor agrees to report all such payments to the appropriate federal, state, and local taxing authorities.
    </div>

    <div style="text-align: left">
      <h5 style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">8. Insurance</h5>
    </div>

    <div class="body-text-small">
      8A. As a condition of doing business with DASH, and at Contractor's own expense, Contractor shall, during the Term of this Agreement (as defined in Section 12 below), maintain current insurance of the types and in the amounts required by law in the jurisdiction in which Contractor operates to perform Contractor's services as contemplated by this Agreement. This includes, but is not limited to, vehicle insurance that satisfies the minimum vehicle insurance coverage amounts and types required by state or local law. DASH may offer Contractor the opportunity to participate in certain group insurance plans made available by third party providers to delivery service providers like Contractor who use the DASH Platform. However, Contractor is under no obligation to participate in such plans.
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="body-text-small">
      8B. Contractor is solely responsible for conducting the appropriate research and consultation necessary to determine the insurance types and amounts Contractor must maintain. Contractor acknowledges that Contractor's failure to secure or maintain satisfactory insurance coverage, including but not limited to vehicle insurance if applicable, shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement and shall result in the termination of the Agreement, the loss of Contractor's right to receive Delivery Opportunities, and deactivation of the Contractor's account on the DASH Platform.
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="body-text-small">
      8C. Workers' Compensation/Occupational Accident Insurance: Contractor agrees that Contractor will not be eligible for workers' compensation benefits through DASH, and instead, will be responsible for providing Contractor's own workers' compensation insurance or occupational accident insurance, if permitted by law.
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="body-text-small">
      8D. Notification of Coverage: Contractor agrees to deliver to DASH, upon request, current certificates of insurance as proof of coverage. Contractor agrees to make available updated certificates each time Contractor purchases, renews, or alters Contractor's insurance coverage. Contractor agrees to give DASH at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice before cancellation of any insurance policy required by this Agreement. DASH reserves the right to require Contractor to identify DASH as an additional insured on Contractor's vehicle insurance.
    </div>

    <div style="text-align: left">
      <h5 style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">9. Indemnity</h5>
    </div>

    <div class="body-text-small">
      9A. Contractor agrees to indemnify, protect, and hold harmless DASH, including all parent, subsidiary, and/or affiliated companies, as well as its and their past and present successors, assigns, officers, owners, directors, agents, representatives, attorneys, and employees, from any and all claims, demands, damages, lawsuits, losses, liabilities and causes of action arising directly or indirectly from, as a result of or in connection with, the actions of Contractor arising from the performance of Deliveries under this Agreement, including but not limited to, personal injury to or death of any person (including Contractor), as well as any liability arising from Contractor's failure to comply with the terms of this Agreement. Contractor's obligations hereunder shall include the cost of defense, including attorneys' fees, as well as the payment of any final judgment rendered against or settlement agreed upon by DASH or its parent, subsidiary, and/or affiliated companies.
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="body-text-small">
      9B.Contractor agrees to indemnify, protect, and hold harmless DASH, including all parent, subsidiary, and/or affiliated companies, as well as its and their past and present successors, assigns, officers, owners, directors, agents, representatives, attorneys, and employees from any and all tax liabilities and responsibilities for payment of all federal, state, and local taxes, including, but not limited to all payroll taxes, self-employment taxes, workers' compensation premiums, and any contributions imposed or required under federal, state, and/or local laws, that are owed by Contractor with respect to Contractor's providing delivery services through the DASH Platform.

    <div style="text-align: left">
      <h5 style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">10. Informal Dispute Resolution</h5>
    </div>

    <div class="body-text-small">
      10A. To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to this Agreement or otherwise arising from the relationship between Contractor and DASH, the Parties mutually agree to first attempt to negotiate any dispute informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration proceeding. Such informal negotiations will commence upon written notice of any dispute by either Party. Contractor's address for such notices is Contractor's most recent address on file with DASH as provided by Contractor. DASH' address for such notices is the Fleet Help Center.
    </div>

    <div style="text-align: left">
      <h5 style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">11. Mutual Arbitration Provision</h5>
    </div>

    <div class="body-text-small">
      11A. Arbitration of Disputes. DASH and Contractor mutually agree to resolve any disputes between them exclusively through final and binding arbitration instead of filing a lawsuit in court.
      <br>
      Only an arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Mutual Arbitration Provision. However, as stated in Section 11B.iv below, the preceding clause shall not apply to the Class Action Waiver and Representative Action Waiver.
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="body-text-small">
      11B. BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES BETWEEN THEM AS DESCRIBED HEREIN THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT AGREE THAT ALL SUCH DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE AN ARBITRATOR AND NOT BY WAY OF A COURT OR JURY TRIAL.
      <br>
      If either party wishes to initiate arbitration, the initiating party must notify the other party in writing via certified mail, return receipt requested, or hand delivery within the applicable statute of limitations period. This demand for arbitration must include (1) the name and address of the party seeking arbitration, (2) a statement of the legal and factual basis of the claim, and (3) a description of the remedy sought. Any demand for arbitration by Contractor must be delivered to DASH.
      <br>
      CLASS ACTION WAIVER—PLEASE READ. DASH and Contractor mutually agree that any and all disputes or claims between the
      parties will be resolved in individual arbitration. The Parties further agree that by entering into this Agreement,
      they waive their right to have any dispute or claim brought, heard or arbitrated as a class and/or collective action,
      or to participate in any class and/or collective action, and an arbitrator shall not have any authority to hear or
      arbitrate any class and/or collective action ("Class Action Waiver").
      <br>
      REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WAIVER—PLEASE READ. Postmates and Contractor mutually agree that any and all disputes or claims between the Parties will be resolved in individual arbitration. The Parties further agree that by entering into this Agreement, they waive their right to have any dispute or claim brought, heard or arbitrated as a representative action, or to participate in any representative action, and an arbitrator shall not have any authority to arbitrate a representative action ("Representative Action Waiver").
      <br>
      Contractor agrees and acknowledges that entering into this Mutual Arbitration Provision does not change Contractor's status as an independent Contractor in fact and in law. Contractor further agrees that when performing Services pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Contractor is not doing so as an employee of DASH, a Merchant, or a customer. Contractor further agrees that any disputes in this regard shall be determined exclusively by an arbitrator.
      <br>
      Right to Opt Out of Arbitration. Arbitration is not a mandatory condition of Contractor's contractual relationship with DASH, and therefore Contractor may submit a statement notifying DASH that Contractor wishes to opt out of this Mutual Arbitration Provision. In order to opt out, Contractor must notify DASH of Contractor's intention to opt out by filling out and submitting this Opt-Out Form stating Contractor's first and last name, email address, home address, and intention to opt out or by submitting a signed and dated statement on an "Opt Out Form" that can be obtained from and returned to DASH at our offices, a written notice stating that you are opting out of this Mutual Arbitration Provision. In order to be effective, Contractor's opt-out notice must be provided within thirty (30) days of Contractor's digital execution of this Agreement. If Contractor opts out as provided in this subparagraph, Contractor will not be subject to any adverse action as a consequence of that decision and may pursue available legal remedies without regard to this Mutual Arbitration Provision. If Contractor does not opt out within thirty (30) days of Contractor's execution of this Agreement, Contractor's failure to do so shall constitute mutual acceptance of the terms of this Mutual Arbitration Provision by DASH and Contractor.
       <br>
      Contractor's decision to opt out of this Mutual Arbitration Provision will relieve Contractor only of Contractor's obligation to arbitrate the disputes specified in this Mutual Arbitration Provision, and does not relieve Contractor of any obligation to arbitrate disputes not specified in this Mutual Arbitration Provision that might arise under any DASH Terms of Service to which Contractor may be bound as a customer. Similarly, Contractor's decision to opt out of another arbitration provision contained in any other agreement shall not relieve Contractor's obligation to arbitrate disputes pursuant to this Mutual Arbitration Provision.
      <br>
      Contractor acknowledges and agrees that if DASH modifies any provision of this Agreement other than this Mutual Arbitration Provision, Contractor will not have a renewed opportunity to opt out of arbitration. Contractor further acknowledges and agrees that if Postmates modifies the addresses for delivery or electronic mailing of opt-out or other notices identified in this Mutual Arbitration Provision, Contractor will not have a renewed opportunity to opt of arbitration. If, however, DASH modifies any provision of this Mutual Arbitration Provision other than the addresses for delivery or electronic mailing of opt-out or other notices, Contractor will have a renewed opportunity to opt out of arbitration. In such circumstances, the 30-day opt out period will begin to run upon Contractor's digital execution of the modified Agreement. Changes to any information referenced at hyperlinks from the Agreement or Mutual Arbitration Provision shall not create a renewed opportunity to opt-out.
      <br>
      Right To Consult With An Attorney: Contractor has the right to consult with private counsel of Contractor's choice, at
      Contractor's own expense, with respect to any aspect of, or any claim that may be subject to this Mutual Arbitration
      Provision.
      <br>
      In the event any portion of this Mutual Arbitration Provision is deemed unenforceable, the remainder of this Mutual Arbitration Provision will be enforceable. In any case in which (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or representative action and (2) there is a final judicial determination that all or part of the Class Action Waiver and/or Representative Action Waiver is invalid or unenforceable, the class, collective, or representative action to that extent must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of the Class Action Waiver and Representative Action Waiver that is valid and enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration.

      Failure by Contractor to maintain current insurance coverage in the amounts and types specified herein or as required by law.

      <br>
      Failure by Contractor to maintain the minimum customer star rating applicable in Contractor's market as of the date Contractor accepts this agreement.
      <br>
      Failure by Contractor to complete a Delivery without waiver of the obligation by the customer or DASH.
      <br>
      Failure by Contractor to maintain all licenses, permits, authorities, registrations and/or other prerequisites to operate that are required by law and/or this Agreement.
      <br>
       Any act by a Party that causes the other party to violate its obligations under any applicable state, federal or local law.

      Documented complaint by a customer, employee of DASH, or employee of a Merchant that Contractor has engaged in conduct that a reasonable person would find physically threatening, highly offensive or harassing.

    <div class="body-text-small">
      12C. Early termination of this Agreement by DASH without proper notice (as established in subsection A above) shall result in liquidated damages of N1000.00 for each day that notice is not properly provided to Contractor, up to a maximum amount of N5000.00. The Parties acknowledge that liquidated damages are appropriate because actual damages are not reasonably ascertainable.
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="body-text-small">
      12D. A party that receives notice of termination must continue to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement for the entire notice period. Failure to perform shall constitute early termination and shall subject the party to the liquidated damages provision in subparagraph C above. By executing this Agreement, Contractor agrees that any liquidated damages assessed against it may be deducted from any amount Contractor is owed in delivery fees, unless otherwise prohibited by law.

    <div class="body-text-small">
      12E. Other than for failure to maintain the minimum customer star rating, or illegal or destructive acts, in the event Contractor disputes that he or she materially breached this Agreement, Contractor may challenge DASH' decision using the Dispute Resolution process described in Section 11, above. In all such instances, the parties will be responsible for their own attorneys' fees and costs, subject to any remedy to which they may be entitled under applicable law and which would otherwise be available in a court of law, but DASH shall bear the Arbitrator's and arbitration fees and costs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as set forth below, Contractor is not precluded from asserting that applicable law requires DASH to bear the Arbitrator's and arbitration fees and costs, even for failure to maintain the minimum customer star rating, or illegal or destructive acts. In the event there is a dispute in this regard, the Arbitrator must determine the appropriate apportionment of fees at the earliest practicable time following commencement of the arbitration.
